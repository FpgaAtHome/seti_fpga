# seti_fpga
Port of SETI@Home to an FPGA Platform

Use Visual Studio 2005 to open and build the following 2 solutions:

boinc-old/win_build/boinc.sln
seti_boinc/client/win_build/seti_boinc.sln

Note: I still have to change all references from seti_boinc.sln related projects to boinc-old from boinc.
I also have to update all configurations to mirror the changes I made to the Debug configuration of seti_boinc to make it work.
